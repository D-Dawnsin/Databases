1) Why is isolation important to DBMSs?
 
2) For what purpose can you use the concurrency relationships you have observed in the videos?

3) Show how to test for concurrency and ACID using the orders table in the sales_db 
(this is just like what you saw in the instructor video).

4) SHOW OFF YOUR WORK! Use Flipgrid's screen recorder to demonstrate your concurrency test, 
and record your answers to the questions above. Post your video into this forum and be sure 
to claim your credit here



1) Isolation is important because without it a lot of changes being made to rows of information could be updated incorrectly.
Isolation allows there to be multiple transactions being made to one row of information, but it only allows this and performs
it correctly with locking. Without locking then like I said earlier, if two people are trying to make a change to one 
row of data at the same time then there is a big chance that row of data will not be updated incorreclty. Whereas, if there
is locking in place (isolation) then each update on the same row of data will happen one at a time and wait for the first
transaction to complete before the next transaction starts.

2) The purpose for using the concurrency relationships we saw in the videos is to help better explain the fundametnals of ACID
and better show how ACID is applied. Moreover, using the concurrecny relationships can really help to present to people why isolation
/locking is important and how data can be easily stored incorrectly if not processed correctly.
