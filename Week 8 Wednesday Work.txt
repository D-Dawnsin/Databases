 Imagine that your company is trying to find the best cloud-based relational database product that would connect to its 
local MySQL installation. Research an alternative RELATIONAL database product, preferably cloud-based, 
and describe in one paragraph which API this RDBMS uses to connect to other RDBMS products. 
How would it connect with MySQL? Include in your post the URLs to the information (including any YouTube videos) 
that you found.

One of the best cloud-based relation based database systems out there for people to use right now is Amazon Relational Database Services. 
This service can connect to a multitude of database engines ranging from Aurora to Oracle and even MySQL. Amazon 
Relational Databases can use tons of differenet API calls. These calls range from "AddRoleToDBCluster" all the way to
"StopDBInstance". Some of these special API calls are what can help to make a connection from ARD(Amazon Relational Database)
to another RDB. For example when attempting to connect ARD to MySQL you have to have a connection string that contains
the DNS address from the DB instance endpoint as the host parameter, and the port number. One of the easiest ways
to receive this is through making the RDS API call "DescribeDBInstances" in order to recieve this information to connect
a DB instance running on the MySQL database engine. Moreover, you can also connect your MySQL databse instance to ARD through
a command prompt call. To do this, it is as simple as typing one long command into your Command Prompt and substituting in the correct
parameters. The code looks something like this "mysql -h mysqlâ€“instance1.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 
3306 -u mymasteruser -p". Moreover, there are some other interesting ways you can also connect ARD to other RDBMS. One way is to download
Microsoft SQL Server Managment Studio and use this as a driver to connect both MySQL and ARD which you would be using a ODBC Driver.
Another way is by connecting your MySQL database to ARD through your MySQL workbench in which one would use a JDBC driver 
to help connect the MySQL DB to ARB. It is cool to note here that there are two different ways to connect between a RDBMS
and ARB through two different drivers. All in all, the API that ARD uses to connect to other RDBMS products can be different
depending on how someone decides to connect their RDMS to ARD. However, there are still set API calls that only people using
ARD can utilize.
